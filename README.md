# the problem it is solving：
We want to help people suffering from insomnia.

With the pandemic, haven't more people been suffering from insomnia?
I used to suffer from insomnia too.
There are many reasons why people suffer from insomnia.

"Relationships."
"Anxiety about the future."
"Satisfaction with the current situation."
"Entertainment that interferes with sleep."

Insomnia has a negative impact on your life.
You cannot concentrate at work.
You are irritable, you don't get along with your partner, and your skin gets rough.
And it is said that the economic loss caused by insomnia is 80 trillion yen (Japan, US, Germany, UK, Canada).

Does insomnia make anything better?
Not a single thing.

But I don't think worrying is a bad thing.
And I don't think it is bad to have entertainment to make you forget your worries.
I have made many entertainment apps.
As a result, I have had insomnia and so have my users.

Then I remembered what I used to do when I was a child.
I wish I could sleep and earn money.

That is why CHILLNITE was created.
Of course we help people who suffer from insomnia.
But first, we need to create a "dream-like world.

Otherwise, we will lose out to apps that inhibit us from sleeping.
It's no use if you really want to sleep but are inhibited by other things.

But? Can you make money by sleeping? you thought, right?
But with Crypto, it is possible.

First of all, we want more people to realize the importance of sleep.
The importance of sleep.
How much better your life would be if you could get rid of insomnia.
It doesn't have to be at night to watch Youtube or TikTok.

You can regain regularity and enrich your life and enjoy entertainment at noon.
Sometimes you want to stay up late, though.

Yes! It's a bit long winded, but to sum up our opinion, we create a dream world.
As a result, fewer people will suffer from insomnia.
As a result, it will have a great economic effect on the whole world.

Welcome to the dream world.
Please let us introduce our Dapps in demo.

# Challenges faced
- Developer side
  - Easy to mint from the web, but hard to mint from native apps.
  - I didn’t know I needed RPC and AccessToken for Mumbai, so I had a hard time deploying it.
  - Need to do it with limited tokens when using testnet
  - It takes a lot of development man-hours to prepare both on-chain and off-chain.

- Product side
  - Definition of ON chain or OFF chain requirements.
  - Game-Fi elements with NFTs as core.
  - Community building
